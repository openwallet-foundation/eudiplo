# Versioning & Releases

This project follows a structured release strategy that balances stability with ongoing development.

## Semantic Versioning

We use **[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) for all tagged releases.

- **MAJOR** – breaking changes
- **MINOR** – new features, backwards compatible
- **PATCH** – bug fixes and internal improvements

Example: `1.2.3` means the 3rd patch release of the 2nd minor version of the 1st major version.

## Development Builds from `main`

Every push to the `main` branch automatically builds a Docker image and publishes it with the `:main` tag.

Use this tag for development environments:

```bash
ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo:main
```

:::warning[`main` is always moving`]
`main` is always moving and may contain untagged or unreleased features.
:::

## Stable Releases

Stable releases are published via GitHub tags and follow semantic versioning. Each release creates both a versioned tag and updates the `:latest` tag:

```
ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo:1.2.3
ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo:latest
```

The `:latest` tag always points to the most recent stable release and is recommended for production use.

## Pre-Releases

Optionally, pre-release tags such as `1.3.0-alpha.1` may be published for testing upcoming features:

```
ghcr.io/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo:1.3.0-alpha.1
```

## Release Automation

Releases are managed using [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). It:

- Analyzes commit messages
- Determines the next version
- Publishes a GitHub release
- Pushes Docker images

Make sure to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification when contributing to ensure proper versioning.

## Summary

| Tag                    | Source             | Use Case             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `main`                 | `main` branch      | Development          |
| `latest`               | GitHub release     | Production (Latest)  |
| `x.y.z` (e.g. `1.2.3`) | GitHub release     | Specific Version     |
| `x.y.z-alpha.N`        | GitHub pre-release | Feature Preview / RC |

## Backward Compatibility Policy

- **Breaking changes only in major versions.** API field renames, removed endpoints, changed configuration formats, and new required environment variables are only introduced in major releases.
- **Deprecate before removing.** Where feasible, features are deprecated in a minor release before being removed in the next major.
- **Database migrations are automatic.** Schema changes are applied by the migration system on startup. No manual SQL is required.
- **Migration guides for every major version.** Each major release includes a step-by-step [migration guide](../migration/index.md) covering all required actions.
- **If it breaks in a minor/patch, it's a bug.** If you experience a breaking change outside of a major release, please [report it](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

## Breaking Change Checklist (for contributors)

When introducing a breaking change, ensure:

- [ ] The commit message includes `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer (triggers major version bump)
- [ ] The PR description lists all affected endpoints, fields, and environment variables under "Breaking Changes"
- [ ] The [migration guide](../migration/index.md) is updated with upgrade steps
- [ ] The `.env.example` is updated if environment variables changed
- [ ] The PR has the `breaking-change` label

## Signed Commits

**All commits must be signed** to pass GitHub's verification checks.

Configure GPG signing locally:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey <key>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

Or use `-S` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -S -m "feat: add new feature"
```

For more information, see [GitHub's guide on signing commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
