# Webhooks

EUDIPLO can notify your backend systems when issuance and presentation events occur, enabling real-time integration without polling.

:::info[Webhooks vs Attribute Providers]

**Webhooks** are designed to **send data OUT** — notifying your backend when events occur (e.g., credential issued, presentation completed).

**Attribute Providers** are designed to **fetch data IN** — retrieving claims from your backend to include in credentials.

For fetching claims during issuance, see [Attribute Providers](./attribute-providers.md).

## Supported Scenarios

| Event                     | Description                                                          | Payload Includes                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Credential issued         | Wallet successfully received a credential                            | `sessionId`, `credentialType`, `format`, `tenantId`    |
| Presentation completed    | Wallet submitted a verified presentation                             | `sessionId`, `presentedClaims`, `credentialTypes`      |
| Deferred credential ready | Attribute provider completed processing, credential now available    | `transactionId`, `claims`                              |
| Notification received     | Wallet sent a notification (acceptance/rejection/deletion)           | `notificationId`, `event`, `credentialId`, `eventTime` |

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks are configured per tenant via the **Webhook Endpoints** resource:

```json
{
  "id": "issuance-webhook",
  "url": "https://your-backend.example.com/webhooks/eudiplo",
  "events": ["credential.issued", "presentation.completed"],
  "auth": {
    "type": "apiKey",
    "config": {
      "headerName": "x-api-key",
      "value": "your-secret-key"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field    | Type     | Description                                  |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `id`     | `string` | Unique identifier within the tenant          |
| `url`    | `string` | HTTPS endpoint to receive webhook events     |
| `events` | `array`  | List of event types to subscribe to         |
| `auth`   | `object` | Authentication configuration (optional)      |

### Authentication Options

| Type        | Config Fields                  | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `apiKey`    | `headerName`, `value`          | Send a static API key in a custom header       |
| `bearerToken` | `token`                      | Send a Bearer token in `Authorization` header  |
| `basic`     | `username`, `password`         | HTTP Basic authentication                       |
| `none`      | —                              | No authentication (not recommended)             |

## Notification Webhook

The OID4VCI notification endpoint allows wallets to signal credential acceptance, rejection, or deletion. When a notification is received, EUDIPLO can forward it to your backend webhook:

**Event:** `notification.received`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "event": "notification.received",
  "tenantId": "example-tenant",
  "notificationId": "ntf_abc123",
  "notification": {
    "notification_id": "ntf_abc123",
    "event": "credential_accepted",
    "event_time": 1672531200,
    "credential_id": "cred_xyz789"
  },
  "sessionId": "sess_def456"
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Track credential lifecycle (issued → accepted → deleted)
- Trigger post-issuance workflows (e.g., send confirmation email)
- Audit credential delivery success rates

## Presentation Webhook

When a presentation is successfully verified, EUDIPLO extracts the claims and sends them to your backend:

**Event:** `presentation.completed`

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "event": "presentation.completed",
  "tenantId": "example-tenant",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "presentedClaims": {
    "given_name": "John",
    "family_name": "Doe",
    "birth_date": "1990-01-01"
  },
  "credentialTypes": ["PersonIdentificationData"],
  "verifiedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Request Format:**

```http
POST /webhooks/eudiplo
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: your-secret-key

{
  "event": "presentation.completed",
  ...
}
```

**Use cases:**

- Complete user authentication after identity verification
- Populate user profile with verified claims
- Trigger access control decisions based on presented credentials
