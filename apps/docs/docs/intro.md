# What is EUDIPLO?

**EUDIPLO** is a lightweight, open-source **middleware layer** that bridges your
IT systems with the **European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet)** ecosystem.

Whether you're building services for government, education, healthcare, or the
private sector, EUDIPLO lets you interact with EUDI Wallets using simple
JSON-based APIs, without having to implement complex identity protocols
yourself.

:::info[EUDIPLO stands for EUDI Protocol Liaison Operator]
The name EUDIPLO is inspired by diplomat, because this middleware acts as
a translator and trusted go-between. It speaks fluent EUDI specs on one side
and down-to-earth JSON on the other, so your backend doesn't have to become a
protocol expert overnight.
:::

## Where does it fit?

    A["Your Application"] -->|"HTTP / JSON"| B["EUDIPLO"]
    B -->|"OID4VCI / OID4VP"| C["EUDI Wallet"]
```

Your backend talks to EUDIPLO over simple, protocol-agnostic HTTP/JSON APIs.
EUDIPLO does the heavy lifting of speaking OID4VCI, OID4VP, SD-JWT VC, and
mDOC (ISO 18013-5) to the wallet, and calls you back via webhooks or session
events with the result.

## Why EUDIPLO?

Connecting to the EUDI Wallet ecosystem is technically demanding:

- You must understand **OID4VCI**, **OID4VP**, **SD-JWT VC**, **mDOC (ISO 18013-5)**,
  and **OAuth-based status protocols**.
- Libraries are scattered, often **incomplete or language-specific**.
- Hosted services can lead to **vendor lock-in** or obscure how your data is
  processed.

**EUDIPLO solves these problems** by acting as a protocol abstraction layer you
can run yourself, integrate over HTTP, and configure via JSON.

## Three ways to approach EUDIPLO

### 🏗 Understand EUDIPLO

Learn how tenants, credential/issuance/presentation configurations, sessions,
and key chains relate — and how the pluggable database, storage, and KMS
backends fit together.

## Try EUDIPLO

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Standalone CLI">

```bash
curl -fsSL https://eudiplo.dev/install.sh | bash
eudiplo demo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="Node.js / npm">

```bash
npx @eudiplo/cli demo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Both options run the same **EUDIPLO CLI**.

- **Standalone CLI**: native executable, no Node.js required.
- **npm package**: `@eudiplo/cli`, requires Node.js 22+.
- The demo requires Docker and Docker Compose, or Podman and Podman Compose.
- `eudiplo demo` creates a local demo deployment for evaluation, not production.

:::info[Documentation lifecycle]
The documentation on the `main` branch represents the current development state and is used for preview deployments. Published, stable documentation is frozen per major release version. This keeps the active docs current without creating a large number of historical snapshots for every minor or patch release.
