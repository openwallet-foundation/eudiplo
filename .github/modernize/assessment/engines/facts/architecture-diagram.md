# Architecture Diagram

This Archify view describes EUDIPLO as a protocol middleware runtime. It emphasizes deployable boundaries and trust relationships rather than implementation classes. The backend is one NestJS runtime that exposes both management APIs and wallet-facing OID4VCI and OID4VP endpoints.

### Technology Stack Summary

| Layer | Technology | Version | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Management UI | Angular and Angular Material | 22 | Tenant, credential, key, issuer, verifier, and session administration |
| Middleware API | NestJS on Express | 12 / 5 | Shared HTTP boundary for management and wallet-facing protocol routes |
| Credential protocols | OpenID4VCI and OpenID4VP libraries | 0.5.5 | Credential issuance, authorization, presentation requests, and responses |
| Persistence | TypeORM with SQLite or PostgreSQL | 1.1.1 | Stores tenants, configuration, sessions, outcomes, keys, and audit data |
| Key management | Pluggable KMS adapters | repository-defined | Signs and verifies without requiring private key material to leave the backend boundary |
| Webhook transport | Axios via Nest HTTP module | 1.20 | Calls configured attribute and application webhook endpoints |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry and Pino | 0.222 / 10 | Traces, metrics, logs, and request correlation |
| Webhook simulator | Cloudflare Worker | current workspace package | Provides a deployable callback target for demos and tests |

### Data Storage and External Services

The backend persists protocol sessions and tenant configuration through TypeORM, using SQLite for local deployments or PostgreSQL for production. Files can use local storage or S3-compatible storage. Key material is abstracted behind database, Vault, AWS KMS, CSC, HTTP KMS, and PKCS11 adapters. Attribute providers and application webhooks are outbound HTTP integrations protected by URL policy checks. External OIDC providers such as Keycloak can own operator authentication and JWKS validation, while external authorization servers can participate in chained issuance flows.

### Key Architectural Decisions

- Wallet-facing protocol endpoints remain at the public root while management endpoints use the `/api` prefix, allowing standards-compliant OID4VCI and OID4VP URLs.
- Issuer, verifier, authorization-server, session, and key-management capabilities are composed as Nest modules in one backend process, with persistence and cryptographic services shared across flows.
- Trust-sensitive integrations are explicit: external identity, KMS, authorization-server, attribute-provider, webhook, and wallet edges are separated from the EUDIPLO runtime boundary.

## Guided Views

### OID4VCI issuance

<!-- mermaid-checked: no \n, no em-dash/en-dash, no {} in labels, subgraphs are id["label"], arrows are -->|"label"|, all subgraphs closed by end, ids unique -->
~~~mermaid
flowchart LR
    g1Client["Management client"] -->|"creates offer"| g1Api["Backend API"]
    g1Api -->|"creates session"| g1Session[("Session database")]
    g1Wallet["EUDI wallet"] -->|"retrieves offer"| g1Issuer["Issuer"]
    g1Issuer -->|"authorization and token"| g1As["Authorization server"]
    g1As -->|"optional identity"| g1Idp["External identity provider"]
    g1Wallet -->|"credential request"| g1Issuer
    g1Issuer -->|"claims"| g1Attr["Attribute provider"]
    g1Issuer -->|"signs credential"| g1Key["Key management"]
    g1Issuer -->|"credential response"| g1Wallet
    g1Issuer -->|"event"| g1Hook["Webhook target"]
    g1Issuer -->|"status and outcome"| g1Session
~~~

The issuer creates an offer and session, the wallet completes the configured authorization path, and the credential endpoint resolves claims, signs the credential, and returns an immediate or deferred response. This view is grounded by the OID4VCI controller, authorization-server service, session module, attribute-provider service, key registry, and webhook service listed above.

### OID4VP presentation

<!-- mermaid-checked: no \n, no em-dash/en-dash, no {} in labels, subgraphs are id["label"], arrows are -->|"label"|, all subgraphs closed by end, ids unique -->
~~~mermaid
flowchart LR
    g2Client["Management client"] -->|"creates presentation session"| g2Api["Backend API"]
    g2Api -->|"stores request state"| g2Session[("Session database")]
    g2Api -->|"creates request"| g2Verifier["Verifier"]
    g2Verifier -->|"signed request"| g2Wallet["EUDI wallet"]
    g2Wallet -->|"VP response"| g2Verifier
    g2Verifier -->|"verify signatures and trust"| g2Key["Key management"]
    g2Verifier -->|"store outcome"| g2Session
    g2Verifier -->|"claims or result"| g2Hook["Webhook target"]
~~~

The verifier creates a session-bound authorization request, the wallet returns a presentation, and the backend verifies and persists the result before notifying the relying application. The wallet-facing route is the OID4VP controller under the verifier module.

### Presentation during issuance

<!-- mermaid-checked: no \n, no em-dash/en-dash, no {} in labels, subgraphs are id["label"], arrows are -->|"label"|, all subgraphs closed by end, ids unique -->
~~~mermaid
flowchart LR
    g3Client["Management client"] -->|"starts issuance"| g3Issuer["Issuer"]
    g3Issuer -->|"selects authorization server"| g3As["Authorization server"]
    g3As -->|"starts OID4VP request"| g3Verifier["Verifier"]
    g3Verifier -->|"requests prior credential"| g3Wallet["EUDI wallet"]
    g3Wallet -->|"presentation response"| g3Verifier
    g3Verifier -->|"verified identity"| g3As
    g3As -->|"authorization result"| g3Issuer
    g3Issuer -->|"claims lookup"| g3Attr["Attribute provider"]
    g3Issuer -->|"signs new credential"| g3Key["Key management"]
    g3Issuer -->|"credential response"| g3Wallet
    g3Issuer -->|"shared transaction state"| g3Session[("Session database")]
~~~

This chained path uses the authorization-server middleware to invoke an OID4VP presentation before allowing issuance to continue. The authorization-server service explicitly supports an OID4VP-managed server backed by a presentation configuration, and the shared session, verifier, attribute-provider, and key-management boundaries carry the transaction through to credential issuance.
