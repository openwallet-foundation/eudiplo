# Credential Offers

Credential offers start OID4VCI issuance. Your backend creates an offer via the
API, EUDIPLO returns an offer URI, and you present that URI to the wallet
(for example as a QR code or deep link).

This page covers request shape and offer behavior. For flow selection guidance,
see the [Issuance Overview](index.md).

## Before You Create an Offer

Usually you create these resources first:

1. A [Credential Configuration](credential-configuration.md)
2. An [Issuance Configuration](issuance-configuration.md)
3. Optionally an [Attribute Provider](attribute-provider.md) if claims should be fetched dynamically

## Creating Credential Offers

Use the [credential offer endpoint](../../api/openapi.md) to create the offer.

When creating an offer, you can:

1. Define the flow with `flow`
2. Select the credentials with `credentialConfigurationIds`
3. Optionally select an external authorization server with `authorization_server`
4. Optionally override claims with `credentialClaims`
5. Optionally enable a transaction code with `tx_code` and `tx_code_description`
6. Optionally configure notifications with `webhookEndpointId`

### Common Request Fields

- `response_type` - how the offer is returned to the caller
- `flow` - `pre_authorized_code` or `authorization_code`
- `credentialConfigurationIds` - list of credential configuration IDs to include in the offer
- `authorization_server` - optional authorization server identifier for flows using an external AS
- `credentialClaims` - optional per-credential claims source override
- `tx_code` - optional transaction code for pre-authorized flows
- `tx_code_description` - optional prompt shown with the transaction code
- `webhookEndpointId` - optional notification webhook endpoint ID

!!! info "Notification webhook endpoint references"

    `webhookEndpointId` references a standalone Webhook Endpoint resource. Create the endpoint first, then reference it by ID.

    If both a credential configuration and an offer specify `webhookEndpointId`, the offer-level value is used for that session.

### Example: Pre-authorized Offer with Inline Claims

```json
{
    "response_type": "uri",
    "flow": "pre_authorized_code",
    "credentialConfigurationIds": ["citizen"],
    "credentialClaims": {
        "citizen": {
            "type": "inline",
            "claims": {
                "given_name": "John",
                "family_name": "Doe"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Example: Authorization Code Offer with External AS

```json
{
    "response_type": "uri",
    "flow": "authorization_code",
    "authorization_server": "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/myrealm",
    "credentialConfigurationIds": ["employee_badge"]
}
```

## Single-Use Offers

Credential offers are single-use and non-replayable. Once a wallet completes
issuance with an offer:

- Token replay with the same authorization or pre-authorized code is rejected with an `invalid_grant` error
- The offer is marked as consumed at the credential endpoint and cannot be used again after successful credential processing
- The `consumedAt` timestamp records when the offer was first used

Important considerations:

- Create a new offer for each issuance request
- Combine single-use enforcement with TTL-based cleanup so expired offers do not accumulate
- Refresh tokens remain valid for follow-up operations on the issued credentials

This prevents credential offer replay attacks where an intercepted offer could
otherwise be reused.

---

## Passing Claims

EUDIPLO provides multiple methods to pass claims during issuance. Claims are
resolved in the following priority order:

1. Offer-level claims via `credentialClaims`
2. Configuration-level Attribute Provider via `attributeProviderId`
3. Configuration-level static claims on the credential configuration

!!! warning "Claims are not merged"

    Higher priority sources completely override lower priority sources. If an offer-level webhook or Attribute Provider is used, lower-priority sources are not merged in.

### Request Shape for `credentialClaims`

`credentialClaims` must be an object keyed by credential configuration ID. Each
key must also appear in `credentialConfigurationIds`.

Each value selects the claims source for that credential:

- `type: "inline"` - pass the claims directly in the request
- `type: "attributeProvider"` - fetch claims from an existing Attribute Provider
- `type: "webhook"` - fetch claims from an inline webhook definition for this offer only

The most common way to override claims is the inline variant:

```json
{
    "response_type": "uri",
    "flow": "pre_authorized_code",
    "credentialConfigurationIds": ["citizen"],
    "credentialClaims": {
        "citizen": {
            "type": "inline",
            "claims": {
                "given_name": "John",
                "family_name": "Doe"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `citizen` is the credential configuration ID
- `claims` contains the actual credential claim values
- the inline claims override any configuration-level Attribute Provider or static claims for `citizen`

You can also override the source instead of embedding claims directly:

```json
{
    "response_type": "uri",
    "flow": "pre_authorized_code",
    "credentialConfigurationIds": ["citizen", "employee_badge"],
    "credentialClaims": {
        "citizen": {
            "type": "attributeProvider",
            "attributeProviderId": "citizen-claims-provider"
        },
        "employee_badge": {
            "type": "webhook",
            "webhook": {
                "url": "https://issuer.example.com/api/claims/employee-badge"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notes:

- `credentialClaims` keys must be a subset of `credentialConfigurationIds`
- values are resolved per credential configuration, not globally for the whole offer
- if you want to override only one credential in a multi-credential offer, include only that credential in `credentialClaims`
- for the full webhook shape, see [Attribute Providers](attribute-provider.md), [Webhooks](../../architecture/webhooks.md), and the [API documentation](../../api/openapi.md)

### When to Use Each Method

- Configuration-level static claims for fixed metadata used on every issuance
- Configuration-level Attribute Providers for dynamic claims based on authentication context
- Offer-level inline claims when claim values are already known at offer creation time
- Offer-level webhook or Attribute Provider overrides when claim resolution should vary per offer

For the broader claims model, see [Fetching Claims](credential-configuration.md#fetching-claims).
