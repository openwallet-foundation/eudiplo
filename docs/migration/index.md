# Migration & Upgrade Guide

This section provides step-by-step guidance for upgrading EUDIPLO between versions, with a focus on breaking changes and required actions.

## Upgrade Process

When upgrading EUDIPLO, follow this general process:

1. **Read the release notes** for every version between your current and target version
2. **Check the migration guide** below for your target version
3. **Back up your database** before upgrading
4. **Update environment variables** as documented
5. **Deploy the new version** — database migrations run automatically on startup
6. **Verify** that the service starts correctly and your integrations work

!!! warning "Always upgrade sequentially"

    If you are multiple major versions behind, upgrade one major version at a time. Do not skip major versions.

!!! danger "Using the `main` branch image? Start with a fresh database"

    The `main` branch image tracks active development and **does not guarantee complete database migrations between snapshots**. Migration files are only finalized when a version is released. If you are running `main` and pull a newer snapshot, schema changes may have been added without a corresponding migration, causing startup failures or data corruption.

    **The only safe approach for `main` is to start with a fresh database each time you update.** If you need a stable, upgradeable deployment, use a tagged release image instead.

## Version History

| Version | Status             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.x     | Archived           | Initial development and protocol testing                                                                                                                              |
| 2.x     | Archived           | First stable release                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3.x     | Maintained         | Introduced automatic database migrations. Bumped from v2 due to the migration system being flagged as a breaking change, though no user-facing API changes were made. |
| 4.x     | Maintained         | Unified Key Chain model, Attribute Providers, `/api/` prefix, @owf ecosystem packages.                                                                                |
| 5.0     | **Current stable** | Field-based credential configuration model (v2), improved UX for config creation.                                                                                     |

## What Can Break Between Versions

### Major Versions (Breaking Changes)

Major versions may include:

- **Database schema changes** — handled automatically by the migration system (see [Database](../architecture/database.md))
- **Environment variable changes** — new required variables, renamed variables, or changed defaults
- **API changes** — modified request/response formats, removed endpoints, changed field names
- **Configuration format changes** — credential configs, issuance configs, or presentation configs with new required fields or changed structure
- **Protocol updates** — changes to OID4VCI/OID4VP behavior to align with spec updates

### Minor Versions

Minor versions add features in a backward-compatible way. However, new optional fields may appear in API responses or configuration objects.

### Patch Versions

Patch versions contain only bug fixes and should never require any migration steps.

## Backward Compatibility Policy

EUDIPLO follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Breaking changes only happen in major versions.** If you experience a breaking change in a minor or patch release, please [report it as a bug](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
- **Deprecation before removal.** Where feasible, features are deprecated in a minor release before being removed in the next major release.
- **Database migrations are automatic.** Schema changes are handled by the migration system and should not require manual intervention.

## Troubleshooting Upgrades

If you encounter issues after upgrading:

1. **Check the logs** — EUDIPLO logs migration steps and configuration errors on startup
2. **Compare environment variables** — diff your `.env` against the latest `example.env`
3. **Check the migration guide** — the version-specific guide lists all required actions
4. **Open an issue** — if the migration guide doesn't cover your situation, [let us know](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/eudiplo/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
